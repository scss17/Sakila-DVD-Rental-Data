# Project

## Overview

This repository is part of the project Investigate Relational Database from Programming for Data Science Nanodegree - R by Udacity. In this project, SQL will be used in order to explore a database related to movie rentals. I will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions of interest about the business by using the database. In adittion to the SQL queries, visualization will be built in order to showcase the output of the quesries. 

Before we start, it is necesarry to be familiar with the database. To address this purpose, this project includes Practice Quzzes that iclude a series of questions that will assure we have mastered the main concepts taught throughtout the SQL course. The quizzes are there to assist us in understanding the database before developing the questions that we wish to include for the project.

The project submission is a presentation, which will be reviewed, and for which we will need to Meet Expectations to pass. For the presentation component, we will create four slides. Each slide will:

- Have a question of interest.
- Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
- Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.


You will submit your project at the end of the project lessons. Your project will include:

- A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
- A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.
- The essentials of your project submission are discussed on the page labeled as Project Submission.
